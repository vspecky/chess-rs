# Chess.rs (Version Alpha)
A Chess Engine made in Rust using the [ggez](https://ggez.rs/) crate.  
Planning to implement an AI using the Minimax Algorithm. We'll see how it goes.  
Note: All piece assets were obtained from [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PNG_chess_pieces/Standard_transparent) (Wikimedia) and are public domain.

As of 31st July 2020, this is a fully functional chess game. Though without an AI, it's playable by two people.
